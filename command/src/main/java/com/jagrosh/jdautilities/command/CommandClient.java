/**
 * A Bot Client interface implemented on objects used to hold bot data.
 * 
 * <p>This is implemented in {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.command.impl.CommandClientImpl CommandClientImpl}
 * alongside implementation of {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.hooks.EventListener EventListener} to create a
 * compounded "Client Listener" which catches specific kinds of events thrown by JDA and processes them
 * automatically to handle and execute {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.command.Command Command}s.
 *
 * <p>Implementations also serve as a useful platforms, carrying reference info such as the bot's
 * {@linkplain #getOwnerId() Owner ID}, {@linkplain #getPrefix() prefix}, and a {@linkplain #getServerInvite()
 * support server invite}.
 *
 * <p>For the CommandClientImpl, once initialized, only the following can be modified:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.command.Command Command}s may be added or removed.</li>
 *     <li>The {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.command.CommandListener CommandListener} may be set.</li>
 * </ul>

 * 
 * @implNote
 *         While typically safe, there are a few ways to misuse the standard implementation of this interface:
 *         the CommandClientImpl.
 *         <br>Because of this the following should <b>ALWAYS</b> be followed to avoid such errors:
 *
 *         <p><b>1)</b> Do not build and add more than one CommandClient to an instance JDA, <b>EVER</b>.
 *
 *         <p><b>2)</b> Always create and add the CommandClientImpl to JDA <b>BEFORE</b> you build it, or there is a
 *                      chance some minor errors will occur, <b>especially</b> if JDA has already fired a {@link
 *                      net.dv8tion.jda.core.events.ReadyEvent ReadyEvent}.
 *
 *         <p><b>3)</b> Do not provide anything other than a String representing a long (and furthermore a User ID) as
 *                      an Owner ID or a CoOwner ID.  This will generate errors, but not stop the creation of the
 *                      CommandClientImpl which will cause several errors to occur very quickly after startup (except
 *                      if you provide {@code null} for the Owner ID, that'll just flat out throw an {@link
 *                      java.lang.IllegalArgumentException IllegalArgumentException}).
 *
 *         <p><b>4)</b> Do not provide strings when using {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.command.CommandClientBuilder#setEmojis(String, String, String)
 *                      CommandClientBuilder#setEmojis(String, String, String)} that are not unicode emojis or that do
 *                      not match the custom emote format specified in {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.Emote#getAsMention()
 *                      Emote#getAsMention()} (IE: {@code <:EmoteName:EmoteID>}).
 *
 *         <p><b>5)</b> Avoid using {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.command.impl.CommandClientImpl#linkIds(long,
 *                      net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.Message)}. This will create errors and has no real purpose outside
 *                      of it's current usage.

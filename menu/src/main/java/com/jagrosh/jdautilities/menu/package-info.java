 *
 *     <li>{@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.menu.OrderedMenu OrderedMenu}
 *     <br>A menu with 1 - 10 ordered items, each with their own reaction to choose them with.</li>
 *
 *     <li>{@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.menu.Paginator Paginator}
 *     <br>A menu that paginates a number of items across a number of pages and uses reactions to traverse between them.</li>
 *
 *     <li>{@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.menu.SelectionDialog SelectionDialog}
 *     <br>A menu that orders choices and uses a indicator and reactions to choose one of the choices.</li>

 *     <br>A menu similar to the Paginator that displays a picture on each page.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * All menus also come with an implementation of a {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.menu.Menu.Builder Menu.Builder}
 * as a static inner class of the corresponding Menu implementation, which are the main entryway to create said
 * implementations for usage.
 *
 * <p>Please note that this entire package makes <b>HEAVY</b> usage of the
 * {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.commons.waiter.IEventWaiter IEventWaiter}.

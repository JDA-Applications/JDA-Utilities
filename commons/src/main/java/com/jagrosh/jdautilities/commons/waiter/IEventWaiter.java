/**
 * Implementable frame for waiting on {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.events.Event Event}s.
 *
 * <p>This interface serves to allow custom implementations for interacting with
 * menus in the {@code menu} module of the JDA-Utilities library, allowing developers
 * direct access to the precise internal function that handles event responses.
 *
 * <p>The standard implementation of this interface is
 * {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.commons.waiter.EventWaiter EventWaiter}.
 *
 * @see    EventWaiter
 *
 * @since  2.1
 * @author Kaidan Gustave
 *
 * @implNote
 *         Event tracking and handling is not explicitly required
 *         when implementing this interface, however anyone looking
 *         to implement this should have a plan for handling events.
 *         <br>For instance, those using JDA's default
 *         {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.hooks.IEventManager IEventManager}
 *         should have the implementation of this interface also
 *         implement {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.hooks.EventListener EventListener},
 *         and add it to an instance of JDA as a listener.

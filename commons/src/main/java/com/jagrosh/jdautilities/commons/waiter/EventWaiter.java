 * <p>The EventWaiter is capable of handling specialized forms of

 * without implementation of an {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.hooks.EventListener EventListener}.
 *
 * <p>Creating an EventWaiter requires provision and/or creation of a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService Executor}, and thus a proper
 * shutdown of said executor. The default constructor for an EventWaiter sets up a
 * working, "live", EventWaiter whose shutdown is triggered via JDA firing a
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.events.ShutdownEvent ShutdownEvent}.
 * <br>A more "shutdown adaptable" constructor allows the provision of a
 * {@code ScheduledExecutorService} and a choice of how exactly shutdown will be handled
 * (see {@link EventWaiter#EventWaiter(ScheduledExecutorService, boolean)} for more details).
 * 
 * <p>As a final note, if you intend to use the EventWaiter, it is highly recommended you <b>DO NOT</b>
 * create multiple EventWaiters! Doing this will cause unnecessary increases in memory usage.

     * <p>A developer might choose to use this constructor over the {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.commons.waiter.EventWaiter#EventWaiter() default},
     * for using a alternate form of threadpool, as opposed to a {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor() single thread executor}.
     * <br>A developer might also favor this over the default as they use the same waiter for multiple
     * shards, and thus shutdown must be handled externally if a special shutdown sequence is being used.
     *
     * <p>{@code shutdownAutomatically} is required to be manually specified by developers as a way of
     * verifying a contract that the developer will conform to the behavior of the newly generated EventWaiter:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>If {@code true}, shutdown is handled when a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.events.ShutdownEvent ShutdownEvent}

     *     queued tasks are lost if they have yet to be run.</li>
     *     <li>If {@code false}, shutdown is now placed as a responsibility of the developer, and no attempt will be
     *     made to shutdown the provided Executor.</li>
     * </ul>
     * It's worth noting that this EventWaiter can serve as a delegate to invoke the threadpool's shutdown via
     * a call to {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.commons.waiter.EventWaiter#shutdown() EventWaiter#shutdown()}.
     * However, this operation is only supported for EventWaiters that are not supposed to shutdown automatically,
     * otherwise invocation of {@code EventWaiter#shutdown()} will result in an
     * {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException UnsupportedOperationException}.

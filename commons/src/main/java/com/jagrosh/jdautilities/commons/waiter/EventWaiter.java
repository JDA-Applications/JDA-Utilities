/**
 * Standard implementation of {@link com.jagrosh.jdautilities.commons.waiter.IEventWaiter IEventWaiter}.
 *
 * <p>The EventWaiter is capable of handling specialized forms of
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.events.Event Event} that must meet criteria not normally specifiable
 * without implementation of an {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.hooks.EventListener EventListener}.
 *
 * <p>Creating an EventWaiter requires provision and/or creation of a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService Executor}, and thus a proper
 * shutdown of said executor. The default constructor for an EventWaiter sets up a
 * working, "live", EventWaiter whose shutdown is triggered via JDA firing a
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.events.ShutdownEvent ShutdownEvent}.
 * <br>A more "shutdown adaptable" constructor allows the provision of a
 * {@code ScheduledExecutorService} and a choice of how exactly shutdown will be handled
 * (see {@link EventWaiter#EventWaiter(ScheduledExecutorService, boolean)} for more details).
 *
 * <p>By default, waiting events are stored in a {@link java.util.HashMap HashMap}, and thread
 * safety is not considered.
 * <br>If you require a thread safe EventWaiter that allows concurrent modification of the
 * stored events, use {@link EventWaiter#EventWaiter(ScheduledExecutorService, boolean, boolean)}.
 *
 * <p>As a final note, if you intend to use the EventWaiter, it is highly recommended you <b>DO NOT</b>
 * create multiple EventWaiters! Doing this will cause unnecessary increases in memory usage.
